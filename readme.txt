All test cases have been passed except for 2:

    - test_interface_nested_interface_reference_with_func
    - test_interface_param_obj_mismatch_fail

I've tried generating test cases based on the names but all my guesses so far have had the same behavior
as barista. Otherwise, project works for all other test cases!
